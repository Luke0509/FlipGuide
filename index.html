      <h2>About FlipGuide:</h2>
      <br>
      <p>FlipGuide is going to be a website that helps me nerd out on the video game "Oldschool Runescape". In this game
      there is a sort of auction center called the Grand Exchange where you can put in offers for any tradeable item in the game
      and buy/sell them. Commonly, people will put in a sell offer for much lower than the average price of the item they are
      selling, because they want coins right away. Players will also put in buy offers for much more than the average price so they
      can get an item right away. You can take advantage of other players' impatience by putting in buy offers for lower than
      average then sell offers for higher than average. This is called flipping. </p>
      <br>
      <p>This website will make use of the game's official API to gather data on different items so that I can determine what
      to invest my coins in. There are three main types of "flips" that I will focus on: daytime flips, overnight flips, and
      weekly flips.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Daytime Flips:</b> These are items that generally have a good margin that don't depend on the time of day/week.</li>
        <li><b>Overnight Flips:</b> These items generally drop in price during the night because people are less patient at this time.</li>
        <li><b>Weekly Flips:</b> These items are either cheap during the week and expensive during the weekend or vice-versa.</li>
      </ul>
